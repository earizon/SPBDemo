	DATA STRUCTURE + ALGORITHMS = PROGRAMMES

Essencial knowledge:
-A data structure is a set of information elements gifted of organization. We can classify the data structure according to the organization in: lineal, hierarchical and multirelational(net).

-An algorithm is a ordered sequence of steps or rules which can solve a determined problem.An algorithm must be precise, finite and defined.

-Abstract data types(ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view. (More info: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-data-types)

-How we test an Algorithm? We will test an algorithm based on: runtime, memory occupancy ,"quality" and data representation.

With this essential knowledge we are ready to start in the data structure and algorithm, most of the previous concepts will appear and be clarified in the course of the explanation, reflection and understanding of the structures and algorithms.
