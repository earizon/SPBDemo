        <span xsmall>There are several kind of memories...</span>

        Nowadays we use some levels of Memory with the goal of achieve the better
        relationship between velocity and cost in our computer systems.
        Memory architecture is used to provide CPU the information required, transfering it into register's memory. 

        <ul>
            <li>Register Memory</li>
            <li>Cache Memory</li>
            <li>Main Memory (Primary Memory)</li>

    <pre zoom labels = "memory, memory.allocation"></prev>
    <span xsmall>Smallest and fastest memory.</span>

    It is the smallest and fastest memory, divided in registers, communicates directly within the CPU. 
    The CPU only works with register's data.
    There are several types of registers.

    <span title>Cache Memory</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "memory, memory.access">
    <span xsmall>There are some levels of Cache Memory</span>

    There are some levels of Cache Memory, for instance, in ARM architecture:
    <ul>
    <li>L1 Cache</li>
    <li>L2 Cache</li>
    <li>L3 Cache</li>
    </ul>
    It is the second fastest memory. It stores instructions and data that are
    written to registers. Also, as Main Memory, is a Random-access memory. (RAMs)

    </pre>


    <span title>Main Memory</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "memory, memory.allocation,random.access.memory">
    <span xsmall>It is known as RAM...</span>
        This memory stores all information needed (operating system, tasks, information for CPU...)
        in inmediate use (completing a good environment of work).
        The most commond kind of main memory is DRAM (Dynamic random access memory)
    </pre>

    <span title>Auxillary Memory</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "memory, memory.allocation">
    <span xsmall>Lowest-cost and highest-capacity memory</span>

        Locality Principle: memories references should be agroupated in a small portion of memory direction's space.
        
        Temporal Locality: it is possible to reference a memory direction in near future (in loops, variables...) 
        Spatial Locality: near directions might be referenced in near future.

    This frequency measures the speed of the cycles in the processor.

    have a higher clock frequency will process faster.

    One of the most important decisions when we are designing a processor is to decide
    what will be its instruction set (Instructions Set Architecture, ISA).

    RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computer.
    CISC: Complex Instruction Set Computer.
    
    -Each ISA defines the design of the processor.
    -Processors with different architectures have different ISA.
    -Most current processors are based on RISC architectures.

    RISC machines use very simple instructions. Each operation must be
    expressed as a sequence of these few instructions. 
    
    1. The language is based on a little repertoire of instructions.
    2. The instructions are very simple. The circuitry is simpler than CISC processors.
    3. For any operation several elementary instructions are required.

    CISC machines use very complex instructions which are very

    1. The language should contain a wide assortment of instructions (one for
    each different circumstance).
    2. They are complex instructions. Then, they take longer to execute.
